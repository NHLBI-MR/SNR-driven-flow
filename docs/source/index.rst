Welcome to SNR-driven-flow project's documentation!
===================================================


What is SNR-driven-flow project ?
*********************************

This project is a Gadgetron extension that provides an inline automatic quality control for adaptive subject-specific MRI acquisition time based on a pre-determined image quality metric, illustrated on 2D phase contrast MR flow measurements in the heart with an SNR-driven stop criterion.
