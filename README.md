# Inline automatic quality control of 2D phase-contrast flow MR imaging for subject-specific scan time adaptation (SNR-driven-flow)

This project is a Gadgetron extension that provides an inline automatic quality control for adaptive subject-specific MRI acquisition time based on a pre-determined image quality metric, illustrated on 2D phase contrast MR flow measurements in the heart with an SNR-driven stop criterion.
